TASK:


The game must be created according to the steps in the link above.
Each student must make at least 2 changes to the game at the end.


My changes:


I added a menu for play and exit.
I added several objects and 2 scripts, when collecting one of the items increases his health, or speed.
I changed the texture of the houses in the game.
I added more materials to the game (houses, trees, etc.).

NOTE: The changes made are added to the project scripts, the rest of the game is only technically assembled according to the steps in the link.

NOTE X2: READ THE DOCUMENTATION -> Documentation-TanksGame
