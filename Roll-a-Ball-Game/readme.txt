Roll a ball: https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball


TASK:


The game must be created according to the steps in the link above.
Each student must make at least 2 changes to the game at the end.


My changes:


I added obstacles(enemy), I enlarged the map, I created a maze.
I also added a ramp that activates when the player collects at least 12 points, then moves on to the next level.
I also implemented a script so that the ball could jump.
At another level, the plane is divided into 3 moving planes and if the player falls after one, he returns to the beginning of the game.
I also added a script for obstacles(enemy) so that they move and if the player touches them, he returns to the beginning of the game
At the end I added a new scene which is made from a portal so that when the ball enters the portal then the game ends and the player wins.

NOTE: The changes made are added to the project scripts, the rest of the game is only technically assembled according to the steps in the link.
