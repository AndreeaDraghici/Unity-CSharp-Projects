# Unity-CSharp-Projects
Computer Graphics Labs

The implementations from this repository were coded using C# programming language .

NOTE!!!!!

Within this project I had to make 3 games during a few months.
The 3 games are above, each game has a readme.txt and a pdf for documentation, details.

The games script was made in C#, and unity and visual studio were used as development environment(IDE).
